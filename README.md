# GRAMS by Grapes 

GRAMS by Grapes has been the most ambitious project most of the contributors have been a part of to date. For some time now with the addition of smart phones to our society, it has been possible for restaurant owners to reduce their operating costs with regards to the amount of menus they choose to print, and the amount of staff they choose hire.

With GRAMS, restaurant owners/managers are able to shift some of the duties traditionally left for staff on to their customers. Through the restaurant managers UI, owners are currently able to "add a restaurant", select how many tables are in that restaurant, and insert the menu for that restaurant. There is also section for owners to monitor customers' orders as they come in across their stores.

Customers interact with GRAMS through the customer UI. Currently with only "walk-in" functionality, customers select the restaurant that they are currently in. An SVG image then populates the screen below the chosen restaurant. The SVG shows the user the floor plan of the restaurant (a premium feature that is being shown off with our seed data). Each table shown in the restaurant corresponds with a number. When a user selects a table, that table in the database becomes occupied and turns red in the SVG file from otherwise being green for available. After a table is selected the user is able to click on the order button which shows the user the restaurants menu.

After a user finishes ordering that order is sent to the kitchen view (currently can be seen in the restaurant owners UI) where it will give information on the table, the customer, and how they would like there food prepared.
