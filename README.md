# Motivation
 Helping the restaurant industry to better perform and produce greater profit, which will also promote more restaurant Entrepreneurship in the restaurant industry. 
 
# Performance Restrictions in the Restaurant Business
Restaurants operate at a high capacity and fast pace. We believe technology will provide the greatest opportunity to remove current operating restrictions and create better efficiency for restaurant operators and owners. 

# GRAMS - The Grapes Restaurant Application Management System
GRAMS is designed to improve certain aspects of restaurant operation. In particular, our system should replace or reduce the need for hosting at the front entrance by enabling customers to seat themselves. Once they're seated at the table, customers will also be able to place orders and make custom requests to the kitchen. 

# Application Stack
Includes:
HTML

# Future Improvements
GRAMS should eventually take customer payments as well. It can also have user profiles/identities once implemented.
